# 👋 Hi, I'm Pedro Campos 🇧🇷
Backend & Platform Engineer | Distributed Systems | Cloud & Infrastructure

I design and build reliable backend and platform systems with a strong focus on scalability, operational stability, and long-term maintainability.  
Most of my experience is close to system boundaries: data flows, infrastructure, deployments, and production behavior.

I enjoy working on problems where correctness, performance, and observability really matter — especially in systems that support critical business operations.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Java, SQL, Go (learning), Rust (learning)
- **Backend & Systems:** Distributed systems, event-driven architectures, system design
- **Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Oracle

## 🚀 Highlights
- 🏗️ Modernized legacy systems into distributed backend architectures in business-critical domains  
- ☁️ Built and operated CI/CD pipelines and cloud infrastructure with focus on reliability and repeatability  
- 🔍 Hands-on with system design, observability, incident analysis, and production stability  
- ⚙️ Currently exploring platform-oriented development with Go and Rust (concurrency, networking, internal tooling)
